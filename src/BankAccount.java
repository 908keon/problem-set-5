/**
 * Just like last time, the BankAccount class is primarily responsible
 * for depositing and withdrawing money. In the enhanced version, there
 * will be the added requirement of transfering funds between accounts.
 * 
 * Most of the functionality for this class should have already been
 * implemented last time. You can always reference my Github repository
 * for inspiration (https://github.com/rwilson-ucvts/java-sample-atm).
